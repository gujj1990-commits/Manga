  "description": "Akemitsu Akegami was always told by his father that \"no one can live alone\"... but he's sure determined to do just that! After all, his father sure wasn't saying it with the best intentions, and Akemitsu has no desire to become like that creep. But when a chance encounter with a young woman leaves him with thoughts that are all too impure, he decides to do what he must - become a Buddhist monk and renounce his worldly ways. But the temple he decides to devote himself to...is full of women? And that same young woman is there, too?? What's a guy to do?",
