  "description": "After graduating from an all-boys high school, Iori Kitahara moves away from home to go to college in a seaside town. He’s eager to start a new chapter in his life–one filled with dreams of reinventing himself, meeting beautiful girls, and reveling in his youth. But when his new abode is his uncle’s dive shop, Iori’s college debut doesn’t turn out as glamorously as he planned! Can Iori keep himself afloat, or will the booze-fueled antics of his university’s diving club wash him away? A coming-of-age tale with beer, bums, and the Grand Blue.",
