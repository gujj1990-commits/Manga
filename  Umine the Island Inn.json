  "description": "Unemployed 19-year-old Kazuma has been summoned to Asagiri Island, rumored to be home to long lost pirate treasure. He ends up working as an odd-job man at Umine Inn, a traditional Japanese café with women-only lodgings and a host of eccentric yet beautiful women. The stuff of dreams for any man - a romantic comedy about island life and treasure hunting, where the surroundings are beautiful in more ways than one!",
